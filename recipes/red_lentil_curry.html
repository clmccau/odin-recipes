    <h3>Prep</h3>
    <h4>Complete these steps first to make the actual cooking stress free.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>While not necessary, soaking the lentils beforehand will improve the cooking time as well as digestion. 1 - 2 hours should be sufficient.</li>
            <li>Prepare the garlic, ginger, and peppers. Set aside in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine the cumin, coriander, chili powder, curry powder, garam masala, salt, black pepper, and turmeric. Set aside in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Open your cans of tomatoes and coconut milk.</li>
            <li>Have the two cups of vegetable broth in a wet measurement vessel.</li>
            <li>Rinse 1 - 3 cups of rice and start cooking via rice cooker.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large, deep skillet or sauce pan over medium heat and add your oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic, ginger, and peppers. Cook for 2 minutes while stirring constantly so the garlic doesn't burn.</li>
            <li>Add the mix of spices and cook for another 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant, tossing frequently to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Pour in the vegetable broth and deglaze the bottom of the pan with a wooden spatula. Add the tomatoes and lentils, then mix well.</li>
            <li>Set the temperature to a gentle simmer and cover. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The lentils should be mostly softened by the end. If not, simmer a few minutes longer. A small amount of broth may be added if needed.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, almond butter, and any additional salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking until the curry begins to thicken. (5 - 8 minutes)</li>
            <li>Finally, add the lemon juice and freshly chopped cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
